          <h2 class="card-subtitle">The impairment</h2>
        </div>
        <p id="impairment">Carol has always loved reading, so her fading eyesight is a sorrow to her. As her eyes get
          worse, she wonders
          how long she'll be able to keep using the computer. All that light gray text on a white screen. It's just too
          hard to see.</p>

        <div class="controls">
          <button class="controlButton" id="listenAlternatives" type="submit"><img src="./images/play_icon.svg"
                      alt="play icon"></button>
          <h2 class="card-subtitle">Alternatives tried</h2>
        </div>
        <p id="alternatives">She tried recorded books, but she didn't like it. She made the transition from ledgers to a
          software program, so she's happy to use the computer.</p>

        <div class="controls">
          <button class="controlButton" id="listenLikes" type="submit"><img src="./images/play_icon.svg"
                      alt="play icon"></button>
          <h2 class="card-subtitle">Carol's likes ands interests</h2>
        </div>
        <p id="likes">She has a computer, which she uses the same way she always did her work. She loves getting emails
          from her
          grandkids and friends. She likes reading magazine articles online, especially when they are free. Last year,
          she discovered that she could get her prescriptions more cheaply online, and now she buys some things from the
          web. </p>

        <div class="controls">
          <button class="controlButton" id="listenIssues" type="submit"><img src="./images/play_icon.svg"
                      alt="play icon"></button>
          <h2 class="card-subtitle">Main issues</h2>
        </div>
        <p id="issues">Her biggest problem is that the text is so small. She's learned how to click on the symbol to
          make the text
          bigger, but is frustrated when it doesn't work the same way on every site. She also finds that her hands
          aren't as steady as they used to be, and she cant always click on things accurately. She likes her “old
          fashioned” mobile phone with large buttons that she can feel easily. </p>
